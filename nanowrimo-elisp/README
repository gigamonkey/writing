Some elisp I used during my successful 2009 NaNoWriMo effort.

Counts words using `wc' which seems to be what the official NaNoWriMo
word counter uses and then computes how many words are needed in the
remaining days and a bunch of other stats over which I can obsess.

Also includes my smart-quote-mode which automatically converts
straight quotes to curly quotes and '--' to an emdash.
